# Standardization
## Abstract
In todayâ€™s social media-dominated era, effective customer support plays a pivotal role in shaping a positive brand image and fostering customer loyalty. The primary objective of this research is to study the complex relationship between standardized responses and feedback sentiment in customer-company interactions on Twitter.
This project focuses on how standardization in responses influences customer satisfaction and sentiment outcomes while considering different factors which can mitigate or magnify this effect. Our analytical approach includes OLS regression as a baseline model, further extended to account for confounding variables, moderator and mediator effects, industry-specific trends and language patterns in responses. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable marketing insights which can be used to shape efficient business strategies.
